# Note App React

![alt text](https://jingshiliu.github.io/note-app-react/)

Created a Note App that can write plain note and covert the plain note to markdown code.
User can also write mark-down code which can be coverted to plain note, or rendered version.

Using localstorage to save the note data. 
Implemented editor by `Draft.js` with `markdown-draft-js` as a plugin.

##### Thought

This project spent longer than I expected because of the editor. First I used a generic HTML `<input/>` tag as editor and then think `<textarea/>`
might be a better choice. However, both of them lack the function to edit rich text. Then I changed to `React-ContentEditable` but `useState` hook has
no effect on it. Finally, the last moment, Draft.js appeared to me and I dived into the docs of this wondeful library.

##### What I learned

Even though I have made a lot of projects, I really didn't spend much time read the docs from beginning to end. Most of time, I just google and find
answer through links. I'm happy that I did this and it can't be done easily without the wonderful docs made by Draft.js team.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
